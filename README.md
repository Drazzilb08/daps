To help with documentation of the collections of these scripts, I've created a [wiki](https://github.com/Drazzilb08/userScripts/wiki) If there are any questions or concerns please let me know with a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Drazzilb08/userScripts/issues).

## Versioning

I've started to put version numbers on each of my scripts, you can find the version at the very bottom of every script.
I do my best to keep up with everything

1. 0.0.X versions are bug fixes
2. 0.X.0 versions are minor changes
3. X.0.0 versions are major changes

## Submitting Pull Requests

I have no problem adding features or fixing issues with these scripts. However if you're going to submit a PR to correct my code **PLEASE** add detailed notes as to why this change needs to be made (ELI5 or Explain Like I'm 5). This will help me grow and make better content in the futre.

**Please note that these scripts are tested by me and a few friends. They very well may work for you but they are not tested under all conditions.** <br>

**Please test and use at your own risk.**

Thanks

## Neat scripts I've found

1. bullmoose20 has some amazing scripts he writes, most importantly the plex-bloat-fix.py script [here](https://github.com/bullmoose20/Plex-Stuff) I find especially useful.
2. You can't have a list of scripts to use without including [JBOPS](https://github.com/blacktwin/JBOPS). I specifically use the Inactive User script and the kill stream script.
3. [qBitManager](https://github.com/StuffAnThings/qbit_manage) Amazing bit of python scripting that makes managing qBittorrent much easier
4. [Upgradinatorr](https://github.com/angrycuban13/Just-A-Bunch-Of-Starr-Scripts/tree/main/Upgradinatorr) An amazing bit of powershell writing by AngryCuban meant to keep your movie library as up to date as possible
5. [Homepage](https://github.com/benphelps/homepage) Probably one of the best homelab dashboard around IMO.

If you think there are some other neat ones I should include or try out please let me know.
