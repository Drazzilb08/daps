Collection of unRAID userscripts

## Note to users
As of version:<br>
4.0.0 Plex backup<br>
4.0.0 Appdata backup<br>
The config files of both these scripts have been reworked and must be redownloaded and updated. If there is any issues with the files let me know

## Versioning

I've started to put version numbers on each of my scripts, you can find the version at the very bottom of every script.
I do my best to keep up with everything

1. 0.0.X versions are bug fixes
2. 0.X.0 versions are minor changes
3. X.0.0 versions are major changes

## Submitting Pull Requests

I have no problem adding features or fixing issues with these scripts. However if you're going to submit a PR to correct my code **PLEASE** add detailed notes as to why this change needs to be made (ELI5 or Explain Like I'm 5). This will help me grow and make better content in the futre.

**Please note that these scripts are tested by me and a few friends. They very well may work for you but they are not tested under all conditions.** <br>

**Please test and use at your own risk.**

Scripts are still a work in progress and are not 100% tested

The plex backup script is a modified version of this script
https://github.com/rcodehub/unraid-plex-script

Features:

- All backup scripts come with optional 7Zip compression
- Most sripts feature discord/Notifiarr intigration

Future plans: <br>

1. ~~Add discord notifications to plex script via this [repo](https://github.com/ChaoticWeg/discord.sh).~~
2. ~~Update appdata script to be "better" script based upon this [repo](https://github.com/SpartacusIam/unraid-scripts).~~
3. ~~Notifiarr integration with passthrough?~~ 
4. Better documentation to readme <-- Always a work in progress...

This was simply me playing around and killing time at work. I know very little about bash about 90% of this was googled and probably is the worst way to go about this process, if you want to clean up the code and make it more presentable or add a feature please make a Pull Request.

Thanks

## Neat scripts I've found

1. [Automatic-Preroll](https://github.com/TheHumanRobot/Automatic-Preroll) This script has been depreciated but I still use it. The new version has a GUI.
2. bullmoose20 has some amazing scripts he writes, most importantly the plex-bloat-fix.py script [here](https://github.com/bullmoose20/Plex-Stuff) I find especially useful.
3. You can't have a list of scripts to use without including [JBOPS](https://github.com/blacktwin/JBOPS). I specifically use the Inactive User script and the kill stream script.
4. [qBitManager](https://github.com/StuffAnThings/qbit_manage) Amazing bit of python scripting that makes managing qBittorrent much easier
5. [Upgradinatorr](https://github.com/angrycuban13/Just-A-Bunch-Of-Starr-Scripts/tree/main/Upgradinatorr) An amazing bit of powershell writing by AngryCuban meant to keep your movie library as up to date as possible
6. [Homepage](https://github.com/benphelps/homepage) Probably one of the best homelab dashboard around IMO.

If you think there are some other neat ones I should include or try out please let me know.
