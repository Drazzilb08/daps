## Installation

These scripts were designed to work on unRAID, however there shouldn't be any reason it wouldn't work on any Unix based system. <br>
However, on unRAID simply ensure you have `UserScripts` installed from the appstore > navigate to the `UserScripts` location within `Settings`> create a new script and then set your cron interval.

> Note: Most backup scripts use 7Zip for compression <br>
> If you'd like to use 7Zip you'll need to download it using NerdTools, which is also in the appstore
>
Also jq is a requirement for discord notifications. If you don't have it installed:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jq
```
