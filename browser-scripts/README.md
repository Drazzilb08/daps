This is a tampermonkey styled script to download all posters from the feeds page of TPDB. This is a simple script that clicks the download button every 0.5 seconds and stops when it has hit all the downloads.

The button may look a bit clunky but it is effective this was just something I put together on a whim and also I'm terrible at CSS and JS.

Note: I do not use Tampermonkey. I run a Safari extension called UserScripts found [here](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts)<br>
This has been extensivly tested on that platform, however it should work for TamperMonkey or any of the other extensions like it.
