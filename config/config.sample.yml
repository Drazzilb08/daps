  #   Please visit https://crontab.guru/ for more information on cron expressions

  # If using the scripts through crontab or another scheduler, I would not recommend using the schedule w/in the config.
  # The schedule is intended for use with Docker. If you want to use the schedule w/in the config, you will need to run the main.py script in the background.
