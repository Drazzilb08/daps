Thanks to him and others who have helped me in making this script a thing.

## Description

This is a script for renaming media files for unlimited number of Sonarr and/or Radarr instances. The script can be run in a dry-run mode to preview changes without enacting any changes, or in a cycle mode where it will continuously cycle through all movies and series after they have all been tagged and renamed. The script also provides the option to reset all tags for any connected Sonarr/Radarr instances.

In order to use the script, you need to provide the URLs and API keys for your Sonarr and/or Radarr instances. The script will then connect to each instance, retrieve the list of movies or series, and rename the media files accordingly.
