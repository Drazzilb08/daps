# Renameinatorr

Credit: This script was originally written in powershell by AngryCuban13 from his repo [here](https://github.com/angrycuban13/Just-A-Bunch-Of-Starr-Scripts)

Thanks to him and others who have helped me in making this script a thing.

## Description

This is a script for renaming media files for unlimited number of Sonarr and/or Radarr instances. The script can be run in a dry-run mode to preview changes without enacting any changes. The script can also be ran in a unattended mode where it will continuously cycle through all movies and series after they have all been tagged and renamed and then reset its self. The script also provides the option to reset all tags for any connected Sonarr/Radarr instances, this can be useful to start from the beginning if you change your naming scheme.

In order to use the script, you need to provide the URLs and API keys for your Sonarr and/or Radarr instances. The script will then connect to each instance, retrieve the list of movies or series, and rename the media files accordingly.

# Upgradinatorr

## Description

This is a script for upgrading your media using an unlimited number of Sonarr or Radarr instances. The script can be ran in a dry-run mode to preview how things will happen without actually pinging any of your indexers/trackers. The script can also be ran in an unattended mode where it will cycle through your entire Radarr or Sonarr library and reset its self when all Movies or Series have been tagged.

## Overview
In this setup You can see two Radarr and two Sonarr instances are used, the script will support an unlimited amount, the key take away from this is the `name:` entry. The `name:` entry needs to match for radarr/sonarr so if you see in the example you have radarr_1 in the script options it needs to match for the global settings (this way it knows what settings to use for what instance).
<br>**Global Options:**<br>
```yml
global:
  radarr:
    - name: radarr_1
      api: abcdefghijlmnop
      url: http://192.168.1.200:7878
    - name: radarr_2
      api: abcdefghijklmnop
      url: http://localhost:1212
  sonarr:
    - name: sonarr_1
      api: abcdefghijlmnop
      url: http://192.168.1.200:8989
    - name: sonarr_2
      api: abcdefghijlmnop
      url: http://192.168.1.200:9090
```
This information should be fairly self explanitory, just remember that if you add more radarr or sonarrr instances just make sure the `name:` field matches to the the script setting's `name:` field
