# This script creates an invididual tar file for each docker appdata directory that you define (needs both container name and path to it's appdata).
# Features:
    # Stops containers if not stopped
    # Does not start containers that were previously started
    # Can define list of containers to not stop during backup
    # Can define list of directories not associated with a container to backup within your appdata directory
